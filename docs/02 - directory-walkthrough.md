## Explanation of Key Components

*   **`.github/workflows/docker-build-push.yml`**: This file defines the GitHub Actions workflow responsible for automating the building and pushing of Docker images to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

*   **`k8s/`**: This directory contains all the Kubernetes manifest files required to deploy the Next.js application to a Kubernetes cluster. It typically includes:
    *   **`deployment.yaml`**: Defines the Kubernetes Deployment for the Next.js application, specifying the desired state for pods, such as the number of replicas, container images, and resource limits.
    *   **`service.yaml`**: Defines the Kubernetes Service, which provides a stable network endpoint for accessing the Next.js application pods. It can expose the application via NodePort, ClusterIP, or LoadBalancer.
    *   **`ingress.yaml` (optional)**: Defines the Kubernetes Ingress resource, which manages external access to the services in a cluster, typically HTTP. It provides HTTP and HTTPS routing to services based on host or path.

*   **`pages/`**: This directory, typical of Next.js projects, contains the React components that represent the different pages of the web application. Next.js uses a file-system based router, where files in this directory automatically become routes.

*   **`public/`**: This folder is used by Next.js to serve static assets such as images, fonts, and other media files directly. Files placed here are accessible from the root of the application.

*   **`.dockerignore`**: Similar to `.gitignore`, this file specifies patterns for files and directories that should be excluded when building a Docker image. This helps in keeping the Docker image size small and secure by not including unnecessary development files or sensitive information.

*   **`Dockerfile`**: This file contains the instructions for building the Docker image of the Next.js application. It utilizes a multi-stage build process to create an optimized, lightweight, and production-ready image.

*   **`package.json`**: This file defines the project's metadata, including its name, version, scripts, and a list of all Node.js dependencies (both production and development) required by the Next.js application.

*   **`README.md`**: The main documentation file for the project, providing a high-level overview, setup instructions, and links to more detailed documentation.
